# 📘 LocalTax AI Assistant – Full Concept (ENGLISH)

## ✅ Project Vision

The LocalTax AI Assistant is a fully local, privacy-first tax automation pipeline for freelancers and small business owners who want maximum control over their sensitive tax data. The system combines local OCR parsing, an AI-powered conversational logic layer, smart matching with bank statements, and automatic form-filling for tax software (e.g. WISO). All core intelligence runs on your local hardware: Jetson Orin NX + a high-performance PC.

## 🔒 Key Objective

To replace unreliable, expensive tax advisors with a personal assistant that:

* Learns your tax logic over time (through local examples and Cloud coaching)
* Matches invoices and payments automatically
* Fills tax software fields automatically
* Stays 100% offline and encrypted

## ⚙️ Core Features

1️⃣ **IMAP Email Reader**

* Connects locally to your email inbox.
* Downloads PDF/JPG attachments tagged with custom filters (date range, subject keywords).

2️⃣ **OCR Parser**

* Uses Tesseract to scan invoices and receipts.
* Saves text results to your local `/data` folder.

3️⃣ **Vector Store + Memory**

* Saves all scanned documents and extracts semantic data.
* Stores tax contexts ("Laptop for home office", "Partial private use").

4️⃣ **Hybrid Cloud Coaching**

* Uses ChatGPT or other LLM via API for deep tax rules.
* Sends anonymized prompts only (no names, no IDs).
* Stores every new answer locally for future use.

5️⃣ **Matching Engine**

* Cross-checks scanned invoices with bank statement CSVs.
* Matches payments within date range and fuzzy amount tolerance.
* Links invoice to payment with timestamped memory.

6️⃣ **WISO Mapper**

* Maps structured results (category, deduction percent, tax code) to the correct WISO input fields.
* Remembers previous mappings to automate future ones.

7️⃣ **RPA Auto Filler**

* Uses PyAutoGUI or Selenium to input data into WISO's GUI automatically.
* Can run headless or with user supervision.

8️⃣ **Master Runner (`main.py`)**

* One single command to run the entire pipeline.
* User selects tax year dynamically.
* Pipeline filters emails + files for that year only.

## 🔑 Privacy & Data Security

* All processing is local by default.
* Data is encrypted with VeraCrypt/BitLocker.
* No cloud storage unless you choose to back up.

## ✅ Advantages

* Fully local: You control 100% of the tax data.
* Flexible: Adjust date ranges, filters, categories anytime.
* Saves time: No more repetitive manual input.
* Learns your patterns: The more you use it, the smarter it gets.

## 🧩 Example Use Case

> User receives a PDF invoice by email ➜ The IMAP reader downloads it ➜ OCR parser scans it ➜ Vector store matches it to a payment ➜ OpenAI trainer clarifies tax logic ➜ Mapper prepares WISO fields ➜ RPA auto-fills ➜ User checks and submits via ELSTER.

## ✅ Deployment

* Runs on Jetson Orin NX + PC (Ryzen 7 + RTX GPU).
* Python 3.11+ required.
* Easy to extend: Add modules for new countries, new forms.

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python, LangChain, ChromaDB/FAISS, pytesseract, Selenium, PyAutoGUI.
* Secure IMAP credentials.

## ⚡ Licensing

* MIT or CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for open-source use.
* Commercial use only with permission.

## 🚀 Next Step

Push this repo to GitHub, adjust `config.yaml` with your IMAP and OpenAI keys, run `main.py` — and let your taxes manage themselves!
