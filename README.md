# 📘 LocalTax AI Assistant – Full Concept 

## ✅ Project Vision

The LocalTax AI Assistant is a fully local, privacy-first tax automation pipeline for freelancers and small business owners who want maximum control over their sensitive tax data. The system combines local OCR parsing, an AI-powered conversational logic layer, smart matching with bank statements, and automatic form-filling for tax software (e.g. WISO). All core intelligence runs on your local hardware: Jetson Orin NX + a high-performance PC.

## 🔒 Key Objective

To replace unreliable, expensive tax advisors with a personal assistant that:

* Learns your tax logic over time (through progressive training approach)
* Matches invoices and payments automatically
* Fills tax software fields automatically
* **Evolves from hybrid to fully local operation** as it masters tax laws

## 🧠 Why Progressive Training?

**The Reality:** Tax laws are incredibly complex and constantly changing. Even professional accountants specialize in specific areas and rely on updated resources.

**The Solution:** 
* **Start Smart:** Use online LLM initially to handle complex tax questions
* **Learn Everything:** Store all tax knowledge locally for future use
* **Go Local:** Gradually reduce online dependency as local knowledge grows
* **Stay Current:** Update tax rules as laws change

**Result:** You get professional-level tax knowledge that becomes fully private over time.

## ⚙️ Core Features

1️⃣ **IMAP Email Reader**

* Connects locally to your email inbox.
* Downloads PDF/JPG attachments tagged with custom filters (date range, subject keywords).

2️⃣ **OCR Parser**

* Uses Tesseract to scan invoices and receipts.
* Saves text results to your local `/data` folder.

3️⃣ **Vector Store + Memory**

* Saves all scanned documents and extracts semantic data.
* Stores tax contexts ("Laptop for home office", "Partial private use").

4️⃣ **Progressive Training System (Hybrid to Local)**

* **Phase 1 - Initial Training:** Uses ChatGPT or other LLM via API to learn complex tax rules (nobody knows all tax laws!).
* **Phase 2 - Knowledge Building:** Sends anonymized prompts only (no names, no IDs) and stores every answer locally.
* **Phase 3 - Local Transition:** As the local model learns enough tax laws, gradually reduces dependency on online services.
* **Phase 4 - Full Local Operation:** Eventually operates 100% offline with comprehensive tax knowledge.
* **Tax Updates:** Implements new tax law changes as they occur, keeping the system current.

5️⃣ **Matching Engine**

* Cross-checks scanned invoices with bank statement CSVs.
* Matches payments within date range and fuzzy amount tolerance.
* Links invoice to payment with timestamped memory.

6️⃣ **Tax Software Mapper (WISO Integration)**

* **WISO** is a popular German tax preparation software that allows individuals to file their taxes directly with the tax authorities without needing an accountant.
* **Similar software exists worldwide:** TurboTax (USA), TaxAct (USA), UFile (Canada), TaxCalc (UK), etc.
* Maps structured results (category, deduction percent, tax code) to the correct input fields in your tax software.
* Remembers previous mappings to automate future tax seasons.

7️⃣ **RPA Auto Filler**

* Uses PyAutoGUI or Selenium to input data into your tax software's interface automatically.
* Works with WISO or can be adapted for other tax preparation software.
* Can run headless or with user supervision.

8️⃣ **Master Runner (`main.py`)**

* One single command to run the entire pipeline.
* User selects tax year dynamically.
* Pipeline filters emails + files for that year only.

## 🔑 Privacy & Data Security

* All processing is local by default.
* Data is encrypted with VeraCrypt/BitLocker.
* No cloud storage unless you choose to back up.

## ✅ Advantages

* Fully local: You control 100% of the tax data.
* Flexible: Adjust date ranges, filters, categories anytime.
* Saves time: No more repetitive manual input.
* Learns your patterns: The more you use it, the smarter it gets.

## 🧩 Example Use Case

> User receives a PDF invoice by email ➜ The IMAP reader downloads it ➜ OCR parser scans it ➜ Vector store matches it to a payment ➜ OpenAI trainer clarifies tax logic ➜ Mapper prepares tax software fields ➜ RPA auto-fills ➜ User checks and submits to tax authorities.

**Note:** The system uses WISO (Germany) as the primary example, but can be adapted for tax software in other countries (TurboTax, TaxAct, UFile, etc.).

## ✅ Deployment

* Easy to extend: Add modules for new countries, new forms.

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python, LangChain, ChromaDB/FAISS, pytesseract, Selenium, PyAutoGUI.
* Secure IMAP credentials.

## ⚡ Licensing

* MIT or CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for open-source use.
* Commercial use only with permission.

## 📱 Mobile Capture Module – Extension for LocalTax AI Assistant

### 📲 Mobile Upload Workflow (Optional)

**What it does:**

* Users can snap photos of receipts, restaurant bills, or other expenses directly on their smartphone.
* Images are temporarily stored in a user-chosen cloud folder (e.g., Google Drive, iCloud, Nextcloud) or sent by email to a dedicated inbox.
* The LocalTax AI Assistant pulls these images from the cloud folder or email inbox and processes them **locally only**.
* OCR scanning, classification, matching to bank statements, and WISO field mapping are done fully **offline** on the Jetson/PC setup.
* The cloud or email is only a temporary transit point. Users remain in control and can delete photos anytime.

### ✅ Why this works

✔️ Adds real-world flexibility for business trips and daily expenses.
✔️ Keeps sensitive tax data local — only the image is in transit.
✔️ Users can decide case by case which receipts to upload immediately and which to handle at home.

### 📁 How it fits in the Blueprint

* **New source folder:** `/data/mobile_uploads/`
* **Optional sync script:** Watches your cloud folder and copies new images locally.
* **Same OCR module:** Processes mobile images just like email attachments.
* **Same matching logic:** Connects receipts to payments and maps fields automatically.

**Result:** One seamless workflow covering both email and on-the-go scanning — without sacrificing local privacy.

✅ Added to the core concept!
